= Code Coverage and jacoco implementation

== Code Coverage choice

*   Needed a code coverage with a lot of details. The one provided by IntelliJ could be used, but wanted to try a more detailed one.

*   JaCoCo seemed the ideal choice for our Java project

== Setting up JaCoCo

*   Used the official documentation to setup JaCoCo

*   Had some problems, but after a bit of troubleshooting, I managed to set it up, and it correctly generated the detailed code coverage

*   With the new code coverage I wrote some new Unittests
