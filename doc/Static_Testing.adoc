== Setting up SonarCloud

*   The starter template for the GitHub Action is broken (https://sonarsource.atlassian.net/browse/SCSCANGHA-1[see here]).
    The fix is updating the given GitHub Action source commit in the link:../.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml[sonarcloud.yml] file
    -
    which happened in commit *#939a3b5a2caf9e2afee5e9f4937515c945579937*.

== Fixing Sonar issues

*   SonarLint is excellent at solving some issues on its own.
    We used the IDE to accept these suggestions after reviewing them.

*   A few issues were related to bad design, and could not be fixed without a major rewrite.
    These are tagged with `//NOSONAR` as the program functions well in its current state, and we do not plan on fixing these.
